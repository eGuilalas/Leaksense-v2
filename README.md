LeakSense is a gas leakage detection system designed to enhance safety by continuously monitoring gas levels and providing timely alerts when dangerous gases are detected. The project aims to identify potential hazards by detecting gases like LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke using the MQ2 sensor. These gases pose significant health risks and fire hazards, making early detection critical.

The system utilizes two ESP32 microcontrollers, named GS1 and GS2, which monitor gas levels from different locations or areas. Each ESP32 unit operates independently and communicates real-time readings to a central monitoring system. For easy network access, the ESP32 devices display their IP addresses on an LCD module, helping users quickly identify and interact with them via the network.

LeakSense provides real-time monitoring with live alerts through a web-based dashboard. The dashboard is developed with PHP and integrated with MySQL, offering features like line graphs to track gas levels over time and live data tables for quick reference. Users are assigned roles such as Admin, User, Super User, and Super Admin, ensuring role-based access. A live view of gas readings helps users monitor the latest conditions. Additionally, the system triggers email alerts every time gas is detected, ensuring that users are notified promptly about hazardous situations.

The gas readings from each ESP32 are saved every 3 seconds into the gas_readings table in the MySQL database, ensuring that historical data is available for analysis. The database structure stores key information like device_id, gas_level, gas_type, and timestamp. To host the project locally, XAMPP is used to manage the web server and database, making the system easy to deploy on a desktop or laptop computer.

LeakSense is designed to ensure safety in residential, commercial, and industrial environments by providing proactive alerts. It offers a cost-effective solution by using affordable components like the MQ2 sensor and ESP32. The system also allows users to detect patterns by visualizing gas levels over time, helping with preventive maintenance and identifying recurring issues.

Future improvements could include SMS notifications for faster alerts, a mobile app for remote monitoring, and IoT cloud integration to extend monitoring capabilities beyond the local network. Additionally, automating responses—like closing gas valves or activating exhaust fans—when gas levels exceed safe limits could further enhance safety.

In summary, LeakSense is a practical and efficient solution for gas leakage detection. Its use of ESP32 microcontrollers, real-time monitoring, email alerts, and role-based web access makes it a reliable safety tool. With additional features and cloud integration, LeakSense has the potential to provide even greater value and usability in various environments...
